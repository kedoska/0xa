==========

This project exposes an ExpressJs server that is a proxy to secure, access, and filter any _Policy_ and _Client_ endpoints compatible 
with **mocky.io V2**Â `580891a4100000e8242b75c5` and `5808862710000087232b75ac`.

### Before you start

The server requires the `.env` file. Use the example file (`.env.example`) to configure your environment. Rename it as `.env`<br/>
:warning: Never push your env file into the repository. 
Contact your manager to get your test endpoints and the rest of the required parameters.
